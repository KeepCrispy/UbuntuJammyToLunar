My build script for myself updating Ubuntu 22 to the latest version of Ubuntu 23.

I made this to try out the latest Ubuntu 23 updates and automate this upgrade so I can go back and forth between builds if I have issues.

Full disclaimer:
Please back up important files before you use this. This script will update your Ubuntu OS to the lastest 23 version. This will upgrade with the latest features and bugs. The updates include a kernel upgrade from Ubuntu to the latest version they are supporting. Features of Ubuntu 23 may or may not be compatible with your gpu and hardware yet and may have unintended bugs. I take no responsibility or credit for the blessings from the Ubuntu gods after you run this.

The script is solely for those with a strong heart to test the latest Ubuntu 23 features.
